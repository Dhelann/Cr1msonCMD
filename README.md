<h1 align="center">Welcome to My Stupid Repository ❤</h1>

**This repository** is your gateway to an **Exploit Wonderland** (or **Hellscape**, depending on how you see it).

Here you'll find all kinds of *verified*, *tested*, *stupid*, *broken*, or *surprisingly useful* exploits — scavenged, or summoned straight from the depths of my brain by me, **Dhelan**. 

Messing with this stuff might just launch your neurons into a weird-ass zone I like to call... **DHElirium**.  
(*Dhelan + Delirium... get it? No? Fine.*)

---

So go ahead. Scroll through this mess of scripts, glitches, cursed utilities, and brain-melting randomness.  
They might not fix your problems, but they’ll definitely *make them weirder*. Have fun and good luck, traveler ❤
